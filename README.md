Computer Science graduate from the University of Guelph.<br>
 <br>
I like trying and learning new things, so my repos will be a mixture of a lot.<br>
Currently learning Go, but usually building full stack web apps or react native apps<br>
Have dabble in game dev in Unity, done some projects in python and C, could call me a jack of all trades (maybe)<br>
